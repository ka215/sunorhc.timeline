**See the future, reflect on the past. Control time with Sunorhc.Timeline.**  
At last, the long-awaited successor to **jQuery.Timeline** is here.  
Sunorhc.Timeline inherits the useful features of its predecessor and breaks new ground.  

Sunorhc.Timeline is not a library that simply refactors the source code of jQuery.Timeline.  
It is a type-safe application that inherits only the useful specifications of its predecessor and is completely redesigned from scratch in TypeScript.  
We use Vite for development and builds, Vitest for coverage testing, lz-string for event data cache compression, and pino for logger.

More details will be coming soon, so stay tuned!
